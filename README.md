The Overview of the PPS application areas include classification, underwriting, projected liabilities, ratemaking and pricing. This section, briefly describe each of these areas.

Classification is the analysis of uncertainty of financial loss and fundamental to insurance. On the one hand, classification is the prelude to the underwriting of potential coverage, while on the other hand, risks need to be properly classified and segregated for pricing purposes. Operationally, risk may be viewed from the perspective of the four classes of assets (physical, financial, human, intangible) and their size, type, and location.

Underwriting is the process of selection through which an insurer determines which of the risks offered to it should be accepted, and the conditions and amounts of the accepted risks. The goal of underwriting is to obtain a safe, yet profitable, distribution of risks. Operationally, underwriting determines the risk associated with an applicant and either assigns the appropriate rating class for an insurance policy or declines to offer a policy.

Projected liabilities are future financial obligations that arise because of a claim against the insurance company. The evaluation of projected liabilities is fundamental to the insurance industry.

Ratemaking and pricing refer to the process of establishing rates used in insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms. This process involves a number of considerations including marketing goals, competition and legal restrictions to the extent they affect the estimation of future costs associated with the transfer of risk. Such future costs include claims, claim settlement expenses, operational and administrative expenses, and the cost of capital.
